## About Purple City Tech

Purple City Tech builds clean, reliable, custom gaming PCs with a focus on quality,
transparency, and long-term support.

Every system is assembled, tested, and verified by hand — no mass production,
no shortcuts.

### What We Do

We design and build custom gaming PCs tailored to real-world performance needs,
not marketing hype. Each build is carefully selected, assembled, stress-tested,
and configured before it ever reaches a customer.

Whether you're looking for a high-performance gaming rig or dependable local
technical support, our goal is simple: systems that work the way they should.

### Why Purple City Tech

We believe buying a PC shouldn’t feel confusing or rushed.

That’s why we focus on:
- Clear component choices
- Transparent pricing
- Honest performance expectations
- Support from the same person who built your system

No upselling. No hidden costs. No outsourced support.

### Local & Independent

Purple City Tech is a locally operated business based in Minnesota.

That means direct communication, faster turnaround times, and support from someone
who understands both the hardware and the customer — before and after the sale.
